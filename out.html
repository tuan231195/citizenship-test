                    <p class="question__explanation">Australia’s system of government is a parliamentary democracy. This means that all Australians are involved in how the country is governed. The power of the government comes from the Australian people because Australian citizens regularly vote for people to represent them in parliament. Only parliament has the power to make and change the laws that govern the country.

In a parliamentary democracy, the representatives in parliament must answer to the people, through elections, for the decisions they make.</p>

                    <p class="question__explanation">The Australian Constitution divides power between three arms of government. This is to stop one person or one group of people taking over all the power to govern Australia.

Legislative power: Parliament has the power to make and change the laws. Parliament is made up of representatives who are elected by the people of Australia.

Executive power: Executive power is the power to put the laws into practice. The Executive includes Australian Government ministers and the Governor-General. Each minister is responsible for one or more government departments.

Judicial power: Judges have the power to interpret and apply the law. Courts and judges are independent of parliament and government.

These powers are written into the Australian Constitution.</p>

                    <p class="question__explanation">Australians do not believe in class distinctions in our society. Instead, we believe in a fair society, where everyone deserves a ‘fair go’. This means that what someone achieves in life should be a result of their hard work and talents, rather than their wealth or background. For example, a person should get a job or a promotion on the basis of their skills, ability and experience, not because of their background.</p>

Legislative power:

Parliament has the power to make and change the laws. Parliament is made up of representatives who are elected by the people of Australia.

Executive power:

Executive power is the power to put the laws into practice. The Executive includes Australian Government ministers and the Governor-General. Each minister is responsible for one or more government departments.

Judicial power:

Judges have the power to interpret and apply the law. Courts and judges are independent of parliament and government.

These powers are written into the Australian Constitution.</p>
